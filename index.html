				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>Welcome to my website where I get to showcase my work for MMP210. I hope some day, I'll use physical computing to revolutionize the gaming industry but, going to BMCC and taking the MMP210 course is a good way to start but I have a long way there from my vision. The MMP210 course is a very exciting course to take and I hope to learn a lot of things from it to better myself for the future and to have more opportunities!</p>

				<h1>Roblox</h1>
				<p>Roblox is not a kids game. Roblox is a game platform for all ages. You may think it's a kids game because the game looks like legos but don't judge it's book by it's cover. Anyone is welcome on Roblox as long as they don't do anything bad or creepy on it. Even teens and adults play Roblox. Roblox helped me gain a lot of game design and developing skills for the future. I started playing and developing and designing Roblox games when I was 11 years old. Over the time, I got some visitors playing the games I've made on Roblox. At 22 years old, I made the decision to leave Roblox for game development and designing and to pursue more game developing and design skills on Unity plus any other careers to turn my passion into a career and not be constrained to the limitations and unethical policies of using the Roblox platform.</p>
